# PlanetExplorer
This is a rework of an old project.

The goal of the project is to create a procedurally generated solary system with procedurally generated planets
I had finished the implementation of faux gravity and the procedurally generated planets, but due to design flaws I eventually realized I had
to rework the entire generation system, and stopped developing the project.

Now my goal is to start the project from scratch with my past experiences in mind.

This project was created by: Jack Hulspas
